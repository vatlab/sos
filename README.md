**Script of Scripts (SoS)** is a **file format** for the inclusion of
scripts in multiple languages into a single executable script, an
**interactive environment** and **notebook tool** for working with different scripts, and
a **workflow engine** for the execution of workflows consisting with scripts
in different languages. It is designed for data scienticists and bioinformatics who routinely work with scripts in different languages such as R, Python, Perl, and bash.
