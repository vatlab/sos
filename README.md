**Script of Scripts (SoS)** consists of **`SoS Notebook`**, a Jupyter-based polyglot notebook that allows the use of multiple Jupyter kernels in one notebook, and
a **`SoS Workflow`**, a workflow system for the execution of workflows in both process- and outcome-oriented styles. It is designed for data scientists and bioinformatics who routinely work with scripts in different languages such as bash, Python, R, and SAS. This repository contains the `SoS Workflow` workflow engine.

Please refer to the [SoS homepage](http://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs) for more information.

We welcome and value community contributions: please [post issues](https://github.com/vatlab/SoS/issues)
to provide us feedback or get our support; please [send pull requests](https://github.com/vatlab/SoS/pulls)
if you have helped fixing bugs or making improvements to the source code. In addition, if you are interesting in extending SoS, for example adding a new target type or task engine, please have a look at our tutorial on extending SoS [here](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/doc/user_guide/extending_sos.html).

# Installing SoS Workflow

With Python 3.6 and above installed ([anaconda python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is recommended), you can install the SoS Workflow with command

```
% pip install sos
```
and also
```
% pop install sos-pbs
```
if you would like to use SoS with a remote batch system such as LSF or Slurm.

You can install SoS Notebook, and register the sos kernel with Jupyter using the following commands

```
% pip install sos-notebook
% python -m sos_notebook.install
```

To exchange data between live kernels in SoS Notebook, you will need to install individual kernels (e.g. `irkernel` for `R`),
make sure they work under Jupyter, and install SoS language modules using commands such as

```
% pip install sos-r sos-matlab sos-python sos-bash
```
Different modules might be needed to assist data exchange among kernels. Please refer to [the installation page of sos website](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/#runningsos) for details.
