class SoS_Worker(mp.Process):
    """
    Worker process to process SoS step or workflow in separate process. This most
    distinguished feature of this worker is that it allows multiple steps or
    workflows to run, and the worker will yield to other jobs when it needs to
    wait other job to continue. Because all steps and workflows use global varialbes
    in env (e.g. enc.config, enc.sos_dict), we have a stack to store these global
    variables and a mechanism to switch between these contexts.

    The "step" and "subworkflow" are presented as "generators" and are executed by
    so called "runners" that yields if it waits for a socker.

    Each runner is associated with a master socket, which is a PAIR socket. When the
    worker communicates with the worker manager, it sends a list of available "sockets"
    and the worker manager will "claim" the socket when it sends the job to the worker.
    Note that this socket is created by the worker and the other side is supposed to
    connect to it before sending.

    A worker also connects to the master controller, which has two main ports, one for
    push (e.g. signature) to controller, and one for request information from controller.
    These ports are fixed so they are the same for all channels.
