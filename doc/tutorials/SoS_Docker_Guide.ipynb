    "This is a big question to answer but in essence you can think docker containers as virtual machines with applications but without the bulky OS part, or applications with stripped down OSes. Docker containers are much more lightweight than virtual machines because all docker containers share the same core OS and related containers (e.g. different applications derived from the same CentOS or Ubuntu OS) share the same base container. Please refer to the [docker website](https://www.docker.com/) for details about docker. I have found it helpful to watch a few youtube videos on docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why docker is very helpful in building (bioinformatics) workflows are that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Applications are encapsulated in docker containers so that they do not interfere with the underlying OS, and with other applications. For example, we can run a workflow with applications that based on different versions of Python2 and Python 3 without having to install them locally and calling the correct version of Python, because all applications use the specific version of Python and required libraries and tools inside their own containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Workflows will be more stable and reproducible because unlike, for example, a local installation of Python that can be affected by other software and upgrades of python, Docker containers are stable and will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The same docker containers can be executed on different OS (e.g. various version of Linux, MacOSX etc) so your workflow built on a Mac OS workstation can be executed on a cluster environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are of course some complexity in the use of docker but SoS has made it extremely easy to use docker in your workflows. "

    "Docker is relatively new and is evolving very fast. It is crucial for you to install the latest version from [docker website](https://www.docker.com/). This website provides very detailed step by step instruction and you should have no problem installing docker on your machine. \n",

    "as suggested by the documentation. Depending on the different versions of docker (e.g. docker under windows), docker might be run under a virtual machine. It is very important to understand that **the configuration (e.g. RAM, CPU) of docker machines are different from the host machines** so your docker machine might be restricuted to, for example, 1 CPU, 1G of RAM, which is insufficient for any serious work. You will most likely need to re-configure your docker virtual machine (e.g. from VirtualBox app locate a machine named `default`)."
