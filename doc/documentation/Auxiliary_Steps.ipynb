    "An auxiliary step can trigger other auxiliary steps and form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). Acutually, you can write workflows in a make-file style with all auxiliary steps and execute workflows defined by targets. If you are familiar with Makefile, especially [snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake), it can be natural for you to implement your workflow in this style. The advantage of SoS is that **you can use either or both forward-style and makefile-style steps to define your workflow** and take advantages of both approaches. For example, people frequently need to create fake targets to trigger steps that do not produce any target in a makefile-style workflow system, but this is not needed in SoS because steps defined in forward-style will always be executed.
