    "2. `init_statements`: a statement that will be executed by the sub-kernel when the kernel starts. This statement usually defines functions to convert object to Python.\n",
    "3. `repr_of_py_obj`: a function that represents a Python object in the language format. It accepts a name and a Python object, and should return a name and a string. The string will be executed by the **sub-kernel** to construct the object in subkernel.\n",
    "4. `py_repr_of_obj`: a function that represents one or more variables in the subkernel as a Python dictionary. It accepts a list of names in the subkernel and returns an updated list of names, and a statement in the subkernel language. \n",
    "5. `py_from_repr_of_obj`: a function that creates Python objects from the python expression returned by the subkernel. \n",

SoS will execute multiple statements altogether if multiple variables are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending variables from subkernel (magic `%put`) follows the same idea. Basically, the subkernel returns a string that would be evaluated by SoS to get the variable. This is achieved with help from two functions. For example, to send a `R` object `b <- c(1, 2)` from subkernel `R` to `SoS` (magic `%put`), SoS will\n",

    "2. execute the returned statement in the subkernel\n",
    "3. retrieve return value from the subkernel, which can be something like `[1] \"{'b': [1, 2]}\"`. As you can see, because SoS has no control over how the subkernel returns a string, some further processing is needed.\n",
    "4. call `py_from_repr_of_obj` to process the returned value to get a dictionary `{'b': [1, 2]}`, which will then be merged to the SoS dictionary.\n",
